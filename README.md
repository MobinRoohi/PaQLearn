# Pac-Man with Q-Learning

## Overview
This project employs Q-learning, a reinforcement learning technique, to train an AI agent to play the classic game of Pac-Man. The agent learns optimal strategies for navigating the maze and avoiding ghosts, while maximizing scores. The jupyter notebook included also answers to some problems about both Q-learning and Markov Decision Processes. The problem statement of the project is also included.

## Features
- Q-learning algorithm implementation.
- Pac-Man game simulation for the AI agent.
- Dynamic strategy development based on game states.
- Score-based performance evaluation.
- Evaluation of the implemented Q-learning algorithm on different hyperparameter values.
